title: the real post
---

okay, i decided to start a blog 

in the beginning i wanted to start a gamedev journey blog but now i want it to be my full description

little about me: i don't have much experience in "real" programming languages as i work in php and i don't have a real pet-project. Hope to change it soon.

so for the start i will learn to do an easy to-do ios app

next step â€“ as app is done
